# vue-firebase-ci-demo

## Summary

This is a demo app to build a CI pipeline with github actions for an app that uses vue and firebase. I also want to include testing for the firestore database rules and e2e test with cypress.

## Later plans

- Include test running for firebase functions
- Include test running for vue component tests
